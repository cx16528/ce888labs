## Compare and plot Q-values



This is a rather short lab

- [ ] Keep only e-decreasing, UCB and bootstrap from your examples
- [ ] Change the reward of each function from 1,0 to 1,-1 and redo the plots

*![UCB_1](./UCB_1.pdf?raw=true)
*![BootstrapTS_1](./BootstrapTS_1.pdf?raw=true)
- [ ] Change the rewards of each function to 10,-10 and redo the plots
		* What do you observe?
		*It is easy to be found that the result improved following trial increasing.

- [ ] Get the best bandit that you have for 10,-10 and plot the Q-values for each time step - what do you observe? 
*We can find that the bootstrapTS is the best bandit for 10, -10 and plot the Q-values for each time step.
